# Minesweeper

### Description
The player's goal is to click on the cells while avoiding the mines. Clicking a cell will reveal either an empty cell, a number indicating the number of mines surrounding that cell, or a mine. Clicking a mine, or if the timer reaches 500 seconds, will result in the player's loss, and end the game. If the player manages to click on all the cells that are not mines, then the player wins the game. The player may right-click a cell to flag it, and indicate that cell as a mine. The player may also reset the game to play again.

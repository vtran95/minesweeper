Clicking a cell will reveal either an empty cell, a number indicating the number of mines surrounding that cell, or a mine. The player may right-click a cell to flag it, and indicate that cell as a mine.

Clicking a mine, or if the timer reaches 500 seconds, will result in the player's loss, revealing all the hidden mines, and ending the game.

If the player manages to click on all the cells that are not mines, then the player wins the game, and the mines will be revealed. The player may reset the game to play again.
